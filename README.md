<h3 align="center">Bookify</h3>

  <p align="center">
    On entering the IIT Roorkee campus, many enthusiastic students have high expectations of leading a healthy lifestyle that includes body fitness and exploring a variety of skills by trying out different sports. But there is a major problem faced by many of these students, for example - students have experienced frequent situations wherein they go to play a sport or use a facility, e.g., table tennis but they rarely get a chance to actually play those games because they always remain occupied.This app aims to solve this problem. Has DRF powering the backend , and Flutter powering the frontend.

<img src = "https://github.com/pranavkonidena/Bookify_Frontend/assets/122373207/67c8d1a1-29e4-454c-8d28-36a4f81a62f3" height = 350 width= 175>
<br>
<br>
Amenity heads are the person's who manage all the things related to an amenity (eg Table Tennis Court) such as Adding new events, scheduling downtime for an amenity etc. They will also handle the booking and check whether these amenities will be available for booking or not. Amenity Heads have to login via their email and password whereas students can login using the Omniport OAuth2 by just tapping on the Channeli button.

<br>
<br>
After logging in , a student's home screen looks like this. Starting from the app bar , a student can access his/her profile by clicking on the display picture in the top right of the appbar. 
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
A user can see his bookings for a range of one week in the future by using the scrolling widget and tapping on the required day. For eg, we can see one booking on 11th Dec , 2023. On clicking on any of the bookings, the user can view multiple details of the booking and has the option to cancel his/her booking also. <u>To redeem a booking , at the amenity the user must scan the QR displayed on this page</u>
